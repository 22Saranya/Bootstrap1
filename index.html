	<h2>MAIN BUILDING</h2>
					<p>The Government Museum or Madras Museum is a museum of human history and culture located in the neighbourhood of Egmore in Chennai, India. Started in 1851, it is the second oldest museum in India after the Indian Museum in Kolkata. It is particularly rich in archaeological and numismatic collections. It has the largest collection of Roman antiquities outside Europe. Among them, the colossal Museum Theatre is one of the most impressive.[1] The National Art Gallery is also present in the museum premises. Built in Indo-Saracenic style, it houses rare works of artists like Raja Ravi Varma. Both the museum and the library benefited greatly from the effects of the Madras Literary Society, the Oriental Manuscripts Library and the Records Office. The museum houses a 19th-century theatre, with the "pit" meant for those who can afford more and seating for the rest of the audience in tiered-seats arranged in a semi-circle around the pit. Restoration to mark the 150th anniversary of the museum replaced 25 fans with air-conditioning.</p>

Built in Indo-Saracenic style, it houses rare works of artists like Raja Ravi Varma.The National Art Gallery situated in Egmore, Chennai, is one of the oldest art galleries in India.

	<h2>CHILDREN'S MUSEUM</h2>
					<p>The museum for children in the complex houses several static exhibits such as galleries of dolls adorned with costumes of various nations and civilisations and also exhibits pertaining to science, transportation, and technology.The foundation stone was laid for the separate building for the Children's Museum in the Chennai Government Museum campus during the International Museum Week Celebrations in October 1956 AD, by His Excellency, Shri SriPrakasa, the then Governor of Tamil Nadu. Plans were drawn and the cost was estimated to Rs.10.8 lakhs. However, unfortunately this proposal had to be deferred indefinitely. Therefore, it was felt necessary at least to start with a Children's Gallery. The exhibits that had been collected for this museum, along with a few specially prepared models and diagrams were provisionally displayed in fifteen newly made showcases, which were arranged in the mezzanine floor of the Geology Gallery. This newly organised Children's Gallery was thrown open to the public on the 'Children's Day' - 14th November 1960 AD.</p>

	<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
					<P> In the modern concept, museums should function for increase and diffusion of knowledge among people. To achieve this goal, they have to engage themselves in activities related to research education, and preservation, which are often defined, as great functional trinity of museums. The Government Museum, Chennai is well aware of this basic fact and acts diligently on these spheres from its inception. This museum started its educational activities as early as 1870 AD by initiating popular lecture programmes under which periodically scholars were invited to deliver lectures on topics of public interest. Soon, other educational programmes such as special training courses on taxidermy and museology for teachers, gallery lectures for students and teachers and publication of monographs and bulletins for the museum exhibits have been introduced.</P>
